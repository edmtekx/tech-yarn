            "title": "Installation of Tensorflow for Mac OS",
            "content": "Background . The official installation instructions are in the Git Repo for TensorFlow for Mac: . Mac-optimized TensorFlow and TensorFlow Addons . There are two key requirements: . macOS 11.0 Big Sur. (however as you will see later the pip wheels that have the packages for TF Mac actually won’t work if you leave the 11.0 version reference. They have to be changed to 10.6. This was discovered by the community. . | Python 3.8. Supposedly available from the Xcode command line tools. While I installed this, I never figured out how to use them, so I just used a standard conda environment and chose a conda Python 3.8 distribution. . | . The instructions in this post are somewhat different than what is recommended in the repo above. The Apple Git repo suggests using a virtual environment and provides a short sell script to try this out. I could not get this to work, so I created a different approach that I have used elsewhere. Besides I don’t use virtualenv, but rather conda so the instructions provided here are for installing it inside a conda environment and it is a very manual process at that. . The Apple developers have said that they will look into creating a more formal approach to using conda, so eventually it is likely that these instructions will become outdated. . Conda installation Instructions . While Tensorflow for MacOS is supposed to be able to work on both Intel and the new M1 based Macs, these installation instructions have only been tested in an Intel based Mac. . These are the steps: . Create a Conda environment with Python 3.8: . conda create -n tfmac python=3.8 . | Activate the environment: . conda activate tfmac . | Go to https://github.com/apple/tensorflow_macos/releases/ and download from the Assets section towards bottom of the page: tensorflow_macos-0.1alpha0.tar.gz . | Extract it to a folder of your choosing. | In the extracted folder go to the x86_64 folder. Inside that folder there will be a few &quot;*whl&quot; files. Their names will be in the format of: . tensorflow_macos-0.1a0-cp38-cp38-macosx_11_0_x86_64.whl . All of the files will have the &quot;11_0&quot; string in their name. This will need to be changed. This change in the file name is (apparently) a hack that the community has come up with - without it, it will not work. . In any case, the &quot;11_0&quot; string in the name of all the “wheels” has to be changed to &quot;10_16&quot;. For example from: . tensorflow_macos-0.1a0-cp38-cp38-macosx_11_0_x86_64.whl . to . tensorflow_macos-0.1a0-cp38-cp38-macosx_10_16_x86_64.whl . Do this for all of the wheels. . | Now install them with pip, for example: . pip install grpcio-1.33.2-cp38-cp38-macosx_10_16_x86_64.whl . Repeat for all of the wheels in the directory. . | Install other packages tht are needed: conda install -c conda-forge -y absl-py conda install -c conda-forge -y astunparse conda install -c conda-forge -y gast conda install -c conda-forge -y opt_einsum conda install -c conda-forge -y termcolor conda install -c conda-forge -y typing_extensions conda install -c conda-forge -y wheel conda install -c conda-forge -y typeguard pip install tensorboard pip install wrapt flatbuffers tensorflow_estimator google_pasta keras_preprocessing protobu . | This will give you a basic TF for Mac environment. You will still probably need to add other packages to the environment (if they were not added by the wheels): | Scikit-learn . | Matplotlib . | Etc. . | . References . Apple Official repo for Tensorflow for Mac . | Issue #3 in the Official Repo. Note that the closest solution is towards the bottom. In the end I did not use exactly this, but I combined the instructions here with the reference below. . | Comment from user nehbit in this issue . |",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master- badges: true- comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts .
